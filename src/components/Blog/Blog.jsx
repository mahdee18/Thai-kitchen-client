                            1.Tell us the differences between uncontrolled and controlled components?
                        </div>
                        <div className="collapse-content text-sm sm:text-base ">
                            <p className='py-5'>In React, controlled components are those that are bound to a state value and are modified via user input by updating the state value. They rely on the parent component to manage the state and handle all user input. 
                            <br /> 
                            In contrast, uncontrolled components are components that do not rely on a state value to function, but instead manage their own state internally through the DOM. They are usually created using refs in React. Controlled components provide a more reliable way of managing state, while uncontrolled components are easier to set up but may lead to inconsistencies.</p>

                            2.What is a custom hook?
                        </div>
                        <div className="collapse-content text-sm sm:text-base ">
                            <p className='py-5'>A custom hook is a JavaScript function that uses one or more built-in hooks and can be used to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic in React components. Custom hooks are a way to share functionality among components without repeating code, similar to how regular functions are used to share logic among different parts of an application. They allow developers to extract commonly used logic from components and create reusable and composable hooks.</p>

                        <div className="collapse-content text-sm sm:text-base ">
                            <p className='py-5'><strong>useRef:</strong> is a hook in React that creates a reference to a mutable value which persists for the entire lifecycle of the component. It is often used to access or modify the properties of a DOM element, to store a value that should persist between renders, or to create a reference to a child component.</p>

                            4.What is useMemo?
                        </div>
                        <div className="collapse-content text-sm sm:text-base ">
                            <p className='py-5'><strong>useMemo:</strong> is a React hook that is used to memoize the result of a function so that it is only recomputed when its dependencies have changed. It is used to optimize the performance of the application by preventing unnecessary re-renders. When a component renders, all of its functions and variables are re-evaluated, which can be a costly operation. By using useMemo, we can memoize the result of a function so that it is only re-evaluated when its dependencies change. This can be especially useful for expensive computations or when dealing with large data sets. </p>
